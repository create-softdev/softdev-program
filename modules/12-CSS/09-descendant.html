<!--
  * Targets every element that follows an identified ancestor
    even if the element is not a direct child of that ancestor

  * Tip: if your selector looks like div ul li a span.error , then you’re doing it wrong.
    Always ask yourself if it’s absolutely necessary to apply all of that weight.
